You create a GraphGist by creating a https://gist.github.com/[GitHub Gist] in http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-quick-reference/[AsciiDoc] and enter the URL to it in the form on this page.

Click on the Page Source button in the menu to see the source for this GraphGist!

== Include a query console

+//console+

becomes:

//console

NOTE: Put the console before any queries!

== Define a http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/snapshot/cypher-query-lang.html[Cypher] query

 [source,cypher]
 ----
 CREATE (n{name:'cypher'})-[r:LIKES]->({name:'icecream'}) return n.name, r
 ----

becomes:

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE (n{name:'cypher'})-[r:LIKES]->({name:'icecream'}) return n.name, r
----

_Queries are executed in the order they appear on the page during rendering, so make sure they can be performed in that order._
Each query has a green or red button to indicate if the query was successful or not.
The console is set up after the executions, with an empty database, for the reader to play around with the queries.
